# Theoretical-QDM-research
This repo contains Wolfram Mathematica programs which were used to perform theoretical calculations related to the Quantum Dark Matter.  Two main areas of research were looked at:
1) The effect of the quantum number _m_ on state to state transition rates of charged particles held in deep gravitational wells
2) The effect of the central mass on state to state transition rates of charged particles held in deep gravitational wells

The main outcomes of this research was published in Gravitation and Cosmology: 
Bonham, M.J., Ernest, A.D. & Collins, M.P. Relations between the Quantum Eigenvalue m and Transition Rates of Charged Particles Held in Gravitational Eigenstates in Nonrelativistic Regions of Deep Gravitational Wells. Gravit. Cosmol. 27, 275â€“280 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1134/S0202289321030051

My Honours thesis which contain extensive details is alo uploaded here.
